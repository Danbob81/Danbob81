## This is me...

I'm Dan, a Junior Software Developer having just completed the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development. I enjoyed the challenges that the course presented, combining problem solving with creativity, in creating four distinct projects having learnt the programming skills needed for each. 
You can find my course projects linked further down the page.
